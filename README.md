# Numbers-Game
I wanted to create a program that allows people to play the popular childhood game- "guess what numner I'm thinking off"- with a computer. In this simple command-line number guessing game, the user is prompted to choose two numbers, then the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within the range of the two numbers. They have 5 chances to do so, if they run out of chances they lose.
