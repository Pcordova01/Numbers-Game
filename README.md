# Numbers-Game
I wanted to create a program that allows people to play the popular childhood game- "guess what numner I'm thinking off"- with a computer. In this simple command-line number guessing game, the user is prompted to choose two numbers, then the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within the range of the two numbers. They have 5 chances to do so, if they run out of chances they lose. 

## Features
- Random number generator
- Scanf to take user input
- While loops to control the game sequence
- Break statements to move from one prompt to the next
- Clear instructions
- Compiles with gcc

## Usage Example 
Are you ready to play?(Y/N): Y
Great! Now give me the first number to start with: 1
Awesome! Now give me the second number (make sure it is larger than the first number!): 100
Chances left: 5
Now...I am thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Put your guess here... and make sure it's a good one!!: 50
You guessed way too high! Try again but do better next time!!
Chances Left: 4
